# Introduction
One reviewer of an early draft of oue "CLimate Change" Chapter pointed out that
for all weather-related events, we presented data in SoCB on the changing
frequency of "events" over time, including hot days, cold days, large storms,
etc.  They suggested we consider showing a similar graphic showing changes in
frequency of tidal flooding events.  This Notebook outlines the way we generated 
graphics to respond to teh reviewer's comments.

We follow Maine Geological Survey's practice of declaring a tidal flooding event
whenever tidal observations exceed the current "Highest Astronomical Tide" or 
HAT level, which is 11.95 feet, or 3.640 meters above mean lower low water
(MLLW) at Portland.

That HAT level, strictly speaking, is defined in terms of a specific 19 year
long tidal epoch, from 1983 through 2001, but it provides a useful and
consistent benchmark for extreme high tides.

# Import Libraries
```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)

#library(zoo)     # for the rollmean function

#library(nlme)    # for gls

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()
theme_set(theme_cbep())
```

# Import Data
Our primary source data is hourly data on observed water levels at the Portland
tide station (Station 8418150).  We accessed these data using small python
scripts to download and assemble consistent data from the NOAA Tides and
Currents API.
```{r folders}
sibfldnm <- 'Data'
parent <- dirname(getwd())
sibling <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

```{r load_observed_data}
fn <- 'portland_tides_hourly.csv'
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

observed_data  <- read_csv(fpath, col_types = cols(Time = col_time('%H:%M'))) %>%
  rename(MLLW = `Water Level`,
         theDate =`Date`) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(format(theDate, '%Y')),
         MLLW_ft = MLLW * 3.28084,
         Exceeds = MLLW > 3.640)
```

We then check each day and determine whether the hourly data exceeded HAT, our
chosen flood elevation.
```{r daily_data}
obs_daily <- observed_data %>%
  group_by(theDate) %>%
  summarize(Year = first(Year),
            Exceeded = any(Exceeds, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = sum(! is.na(Exceeds)),
            .groups = 'drop')

```

Finally, we group daily observations by year, and count up days with flooding.
```{r annual_data}
obs_annual <- obs_daily %>%
  filter(n == 24) %>%  # eliminate any partial records
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(Days = n(),
            Floods = sum(Exceeded),
            NoFloods = Days - Floods,
            prob_flood = Floods/Days,
            .groups = 'drop')
```

# Generalized Linear Model
We fit a binomial model to the number of days flooded versus the number of '
days without flooding, thus estimating the annual daily probability of flooding.
```{r glm}
the_glm <- glm(cbind(Floods, NoFloods) ~ Year, family = 'binomial',
               data = obs_annual)

obs_annual <- obs_annual %>%
  mutate(predict = predict(the_glm, type = 'response'))
```

## Graphics
We have a decision to make figuring out what to present. We do not have 365
days of data from each year, so the total number of flood events is (slightly)
biased by annual samples.  In years with incomplete data, we would naturally
expect to observe fewer days with tidal flooding.  Luckily, in this context, 
and based on available data from Portland, the difference is largely immaterial.

### Daily Probability of Flooding
We start with a figure where the value we show on the Y axis is the daily 
probability of there being a flooding event.  Each dot in this image is scaled
by the actual number of days for which we have data.

#### Create Annotatons 
```{r annotations_prob}
annot_data <- obs_annual %>%
  filter(Year %in% c(1912, 2019)) %>%
  mutate(annot = paste("\u00B1", 
                       round(365 * predict,1),
                       'Floods\nper Year'),
         height = c(0.02, 0.05)) %>%
  
  select(Year, height, annot)
annot_data
```

#### produce the Plot
```{r probability_plot}
plt <- ggplot(obs_annual, aes(Year, prob_flood)) +
  geom_point(color =cbep_colors()[6]) +
  geom_line(aes(y = predict),
            color = cbep_colors()[5]) +
  
  ylab('Daily Probability of\nCoastal Flooding' ) +

  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1920, 1940, 1960, 1980, 2000, 2020)) +
    
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12)
```

```{r annotate_probablility_plot}
plt +
  geom_text(aes(x = Year, y = height, label = annot, hjust = c(0,1)),
            data = annot_data, size = 3)

ggsave('figures/Portland_tidal_flooding_probability.pdf', 
       device = cairo_pdf, width = 5, height = 3)
```

That graphic is in some ways superior to the graphic we develop next, since the
Y axis values of the prediction line and the data points are fully consistent.  
But the  Y axis scale (with low daily probablities) may be confusing to some 
readers.  Furthermore, in this graphic, the position of the dots reflects 
an assumption about the exchangeability of days of the year. We don't really
beliee that the probability of flooding is equal.  For example, flood events 
are likely to be more probable at some times of year than others.

The choice of which graphic is more appropriate may rest on just how incomplete 
the data is from earlier years.  For Portland, the data from most years is 
nearly complete, so the choice makes little difference.

### Number of Days of with Recorded Flooding
Here, we prepare an alternative graphic that scales the Y axis by the number of 
days per year with observed tidal flood events.


```{r annotations_count}
annot_data <- obs_annual %>%
  filter(Year %in% c(1912, 2019)) %>%
  mutate(annot = paste("\u00B1", 
                       round(365 * predict,1),
                       'Floods\nper Year'),
         height = c(7, 18)) %>%
  
  select(Year, height, annot)
annot_data
```

```{r count_plot}
plt2 <- ggplot(obs_annual, aes(Year, Floods)) +
  geom_point(color =cbep_colors()[4]) +
  geom_line(aes(y = predict * 365),
            color = cbep_colors()[5]) +
  
  ylab('Days with Coastal Flooding') +
  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1920, 1940, 1960, 1980, 2000, 2020)) +
    
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12)
```

```{r annotate_count_plot}
plt2 +
  geom_text(aes(x = Year, y = height, label = annot, hjust = c(0,1)),
            data = annot_data, size = 3)

ggsave('figures/Portland_tidal_flooding_count.pdf', 
       device = cairo_pdf, width = 5, height = 3)
```

#### Smaller Version
```{r smaller_graphic, fig.height = 2.25, fig.width  = 2.25}
plt2 +
  geom_text(aes(x = Year, y = height, label = annot, hjust = c(0,1)),
            data = annot_data, size = 2) +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 9)

ggsave('figures/small_Portland_tidal_flooding_count_small.pdf', 
       device = cairo_pdf, width = 2.25, height = 2.25)
```

#### Lightly Modified for Powerpoint Use
```{r fig.height = 6, fig.width  = 6}
plt3 <- ggplot(obs_annual, aes(Year, Floods)) +
  geom_point(color =cbep_colors()[4], size = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(y = predict * 365),
            color = cbep_colors()[5],
            size = 1) +
  
  ylab('Days with Coastal Flooding') +
  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1920, 1940, 1960, 1980, 2000, 2020))
```


```{r annotate_graphic, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
plt3 +
  geom_text(aes(x = Year, y = height, label = annot, hjust = c(0,1)),
            data = annot_data, size = 4.5)

ggsave('figures/Portland_tidal_flooding_count_square.png', type='cairo',
         width = 6, height = 6)

```
