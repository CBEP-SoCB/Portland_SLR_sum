# Introduction
One reviewer pointed out that for all weather-related events, we presented data
in SoCB on the changing frequency of "events" over time, including hot days,
cold days, large storms, etc.  They suggested we consider showing a similar
graphic showing changes in frequency of tidal flooding events.  This Notebook
takes a look at the historical record.

We follow Maine Geological Survey's practice of declaring a tidal flooding event
whenever tidal observations exceed the current "Highest Astronomical Tide" or 
HAT level, which is 11.95 feet, or 	3.640 meters above mean lower low water
(MLLW) at Portland.

That HAT level, strictly speaking, is defined in terms of a specific 19 year
long tidal epoch, from 1983 through 2001, but it provides a useful and
consistent benchmark for extreme high tides.

In this notebook, we generate a revised versions of a tidal exceedences graphic
for use in Powerpoint.  The changes include drawing a larger figure, not using a 
glyph that does not show up correctly in the default graphics renderer, and
adjusting dot and line sizes for a powerpoint setting.

# Import Libraries
```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)

#library(zoo)     # for the rollmean function

```

# Import Data
Our primary source data is hourly data on observed and predicted water levels at
the Portland tide station (Station 8418150).  We accessed these data using small
python scripts to download and assemble consistent data from the NOAA Tides and
Currents API.  Details are provided in the "Original Data" folder.

```{r folders}
sibfldnm <- 'Original Data'
parent <- dirname(getwd())
sibling <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```


```{r load_observed_data}
fn <- 'portland_tides_hourly.csv'
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

observed_data  <- read_csv(fpath, col_types = cols(Time = col_time('%H:%M'))) %>%
  rename(MLLW = `Water Level`,
         theDate =`Date`) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(format(theDate, '%Y')),
         MLLW_ft = MLLW * 3.28084,
         Exceeds = MLLW > 3.640)
```

```{r}
obs_daily <- observed_data %>%
  group_by(theDate) %>%
  summarize(Year = first(Year),
            Exceeded = any(Exceeds, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = sum(! is.na(Exceeds)),
            .groups = 'drop')
```

```{r}
obs_annual <- obs_daily %>%
  filter(n == 24) %>%  # eliminate any partial records
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(Days = n(),
            Floods = sum(Exceeded),
            NoFloods = Days - Floods,
            prob_flood = Floods/Days,
            .groups = 'drop')
```

# Generalized Linear Model
We fit a binomial model to the number of days flooded versus the number of
days without flooding, thus estimating the annual daily probability of flooding.
```{r}
the_glm <- glm(cbind(Floods, NoFloods) ~ Year, family = 'binomial',
               data = obs_annual)
summary(the_glm)
```

## Revised Graphic For Powerpoint
```{r}
obs_annual <- obs_annual %>%
  mutate(predict = predict(the_glm, type = 'response'))
```

# Number of Days with Recorded Flooding  
```{r fig.height = 6, fig.width  = 6}
plt2 <- ggplot(obs_annual, aes(Year, Floods)) +
  geom_point(color =cbep_colors()[4], size = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(y = predict * 365),
            color = cbep_colors()[5],
            size = 1) +

  filter(Year %in% c(1912, 2018)) %>%

                       round(365 * predict,1),
